# You can live ten years longer than others?

> Believe it or not, each of us has a chance to live ten years longer than everyone else. Realizing this, you seem to have a life cheating device. Compared with other people, you have won at the starting point.

First of all, you have to accept a concept: each of us’s time is valuable. If you don't have this concept, then even if you have more than ten years, more than a hundred years than other people, it is just a silly living, turning yourself into a walking dead, worthless.

To truly recognize the value of time, you have to know an important characteristic of time-irreversibility.

If you do something, you cannot do another. If you choose to spend your time playing games, watching movies, and reading novels, you cannot spend your time reading, studying, or sitting and enjoying. Of course you can choose the **parallel** operation. For example, you can play games while listening to music; you can choose to exercise while listening to lessons. But as far as current research is concerned, parallel operations are more likely to be a way to shift your brain's attention in time.

> You can try to do something like this: raise your left arm, make a fist and then face yourself with the palm of your hand, try to rotate with your arm. Of course, this operation is not difficult for normal people. Now raise your right arm, with the same palm facing you, and do a rotation different from the direction of movement of your left arm. This is very difficult for anyone who has not been trained.

So I may realize that any person you have encountered who can handle multiple things at the same time is what the computer field says is **parallel** operation. It is likely that his attention can be drifted at the same time. Concentrate instantly. For example, if you have music in your room, you can occasionally put down your pen to listen to the melody of the music while writing your homework, then put away your idea of ​​being a musician, and return to your homework.

Time is like this, so and so can not be like that.

There is a saying that the cells of the human body will be metabolized and replaced every three months. With the death of old cells, new cells are born gorgeously. Due to the difference in the time and interval of the metabolism of different cells, all cells in the body are replaced. It takes seven years, that is to say, physiologically, we are another person every seven years. You are you, but you are not you anymore.

**This also explains why the value of time is very important to each of us. It is so important that the width and depth of time constitute your life. **

I often re-read the things I have experienced in my life in my mind. The result is that doing so often gives me a new experience. After so many times, I have a new experience, and then I experience the joy of expanding the width of my life. .

When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I learned a text "A race against time". There are some words in this book that were not important when I first saw them. After so many years, I have some new experiences. .

-Everything in all time will never come back. Your yesterday has passed, it will always become yesterday, and you can never go back to yesterday.
-One day when I came home from school, I saw that the sun was about to set, so I made up my mind and said: "I will go home faster than the sun." I rushed back, and when I was standing in the courtyard panting, I saw that the sun was still out. Half of my face, I jumped up happily. I outperformed the sun that day. In the future, I would often do such games, sometimes racing against the sun, sometimes against the northwest wind, and sometimes a summer homework, I finished it in ten days. At that time, I used to do my brother's 5th grade homework in the third grade.

This is also a necessary stage for the person in the song to go through if you don't know the meaning of the song when you first hear it.

> Note: This is not the addictive behavior of secreting dopamine, it may be more similar to the pleasure brought by amine polyphenols. Can bring calmness and comfort.

The width of life can be broadened, and the depth can be self-discovered. I'm slowly trying the subject of depth, so I don't make much judgment. Of course, this is not something that can be written in just one or two articles, so I will only discuss how to broaden the width of life.

Li Xiao said that if we calculate the average life span of each of us as **78** years,

>-The total sleeping time is about 28.3 years;
>-Work occupies 10.5 years of our lives;
>-9 years spent on various social media;
>-The time spent on housework is 6 years;
>-The time spent on eating and drinking is 4 years;
>-The time spent in real education is really not long, only 3.5 years;
>-3 years spent on makeup;
>-The time spent on shopping is 2.5 years;
>-1.5 years spent caring for children;
>-1.3 years spent on the road;

Counting this way, the time at our disposal is only 9 years left...

In this era, each of us has more or less time as shown in the above picture, with only 9 years of self-control. Think about your every day. 9 years, which corresponds to 78 years of your life, is about 11%.

Is your day like the picture above? Sleeping for most of the time, working and studying for most of the time, some socializing, doing housework... Then what can be done to make you live ten years longer than others?

I thought about this problem seriously, so I started to count the number of national statutory holidays in 2021. I was surprised to find that statutory holidays account for about one-third of the total time of a year...

>11+11+8+8+12+9+9+9+8+14+8+8=115

So you probably understand that if you work hard and you work hard enough, you can concentrate about one-third of the time each year to do what you want to do. In the long river of time, one day you will Ten years longer than others to do something you want to do.

-You can learn musical instruments, play the guitar, try to learn music theory, and think that the songs on the market are a bit old-fashioned, you can try to make some otherworldly songs; you can also be a cover singer and study something A pop singer’s creative habits and beats make him a cover queen.
-You can learn programming and try to make an application you like. You think that many somatosensory interactive websites on the market are not in your eyes. You can try to do what you like, but no one has done it yet Things that have been there.
-You can be a chef and try to cook some dark dishes. Maybe you will discover something new? Maybe you became the first person to eat crabs?

> Former US President Carter said: "Ordinary leaders take people where they want to go. Great leaders take people where they don't necessarily want to go, but should go."

You can be the leader of your time and start slowly with ordinary leaders. To a certain extent, the unpredictability of the future often makes us wonder what kind of person we will become.

And who we are in the future depends on how we are now the leaders of our time.
