The past universe was in a state of infinitely high density and temperature before a finite time. This state is called a singularity. This high-temperature and high-density phase in the very early stage of the universe is called the "Big Bang", which is regarded as the birth period of our universe. So far, this period of the Big Bang has a history of 13.7 billion years.

In the early days of the universe, it was composed of homogeneous and isotropic high-density, high-temperature and high-pressure matter. And very fast expansion and cooling occurred very early.

In less than one second, the density of the universe changed rapidly, various forces (strong interaction, weak interaction, electromagnetic interaction) began to peel off, atomic trinos began to freely travel through space, and the temperature dropped rapidly, neutrinos Escaping outward, the electron annihilation reaction appears, [nuclear force](https://baike.baidu.com/item/nuclear force) is not enough to restrain [neutron](https://baike.baidu.com/item /Neutron) and [proton](https://baike.baidu.com/item/proton/65645).

# The Milky Way was produced during the explosion of the universe, it is lonely

The Milky Way is a lonely little spot in the universe, and the Milky Way is its body. It rubs its eyes from time to time, and then produces the black hole in the center of its eye—its pupil. It doesn’t know where it came from or where it came from. Looking at its body, every planet is like its cell. Thousands of spherical planets make up its body. Sometimes it’s lucky. The astral body will produce some parasites that it considers to be life, but it doesn't care. Life that uses the law of blocking entropy increase as a carrier may survive for a period of time, but it is meaningless.

Sometimes, it will notice the nebula far away from itself, who is not living alone in the universe?

Most of the nebulae in the universe are made of gas. If you try to enter, you will go straight through and never return. The glamorous face is the product of extreme rage,

**Anything in the universe that cannot be seen is full of horrors and traps. **

Andromeda is very close to herself, and has inadvertently been getting closer and closer to herself. Four billion years later, she will be in contact with herself, and it even thinks of the name after they come into contact and is called "[Milkomeda]( https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda Galaxy-Collision of the Milky Way)", maybe it’s good to fall in love?

In Coma, the galaxy has a striking dark dust band, lying in front of the bright galaxy core, this nebula seems to be very cold, with bright black dust bands around the eyes.

The wheel galaxy, which looks like a wheel, 200 million years ago, a smaller galaxy crashed into the center of a larger galaxy. As the gravity at the center of a larger galaxy is distorted by a small galaxy, a shock wave is generated that rushes from the center to the outside, compressing the outer nebula and forming new stars.

The cigar galaxy is 12 million light-years away. Its [brightness](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/光度#astronomy) is about 5 times that of the entire Milky Way, and its center is 100 brighter than the center of the Milky Way. Times.

> Thousands of stars are born every second in the universe, and inexplicable things like the Milky Way are formed hundreds of billions of times.
>
> **Sometimes a star explodes in space before halfway through the Milky Way. We can live here. At this moment, this is a miracle in itself. **

It accidentally discovered a dazzling golden yellow planet. During its billion years of helium nuclear fusion, it continuously emitted various particles around itself. Because of the huge mass of this planet, its gravity can accumulate to extremely high temperatures. The higher the temperature, the faster the movement of the nuclei. When it reaches one million degrees Celsius, the electromagnetic force of the nucleus will not be able to stop the high-speed running atomic nuclei from each other. The power of collision. So the strong force of the atomic nucleus finally combines in an instant and makes the matter release huge energy.

This is how Taiyuan was born, the way the sun and all stars in the universe were born.

**Stars are born, grow up, and... Then what happens? **

** Will they die? Did they die silently or vigorously? **

The answer lies somewhere on the edge of the universe.

Luminous clouds, hanging in the sky, surround stars that once resembled our sun—the only thing they have left is these colorful gas. ** Various elements formed by nuclear fusion reactions deep inside the star are released into space when the star dies. **

**The green and purple ones are hydrogen and helium, which are the original raw materials of the universe. The red and blue ones are nitrogen and oxygen, which are the materials that make up life on earth. **

**For our survival, such stars must die. **

**Every atom in our body is produced by nuclear fusion of these dead stars. We are all stellar materials, and our family tree goes back to this point. **

The energy of the sun is produced by the elements deep within itself during transmutation, and this energy is released in the form of strong radiation. These "light particles", or light quanta, move from the center of the sun to the surface. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second, and the radius of the sun is 700,000 kilometers. Therefore, if the light quantum walks in a straight line, it only takes **2 seconds** to reach the surface from the center.

But this is definitely not the case. As the light quanta advances outward, they will collide with countless atoms and electrons inside the sun. The free path of light quanta in the sun is about 1 cm, and the radius of the sun is 70 billion.

In this way, the time spent on the entire journey is 150,000,000,000 seconds, which is 5,000 years!

Every photon shining on us was produced fifty centuries ago. When primitive humans wandered through the grasslands of Africa, this light quantum had already been produced from the sun, and reached us until today. Or maybe in the far depths of the universe, our kind is walking and evolving.

When the star is dying, its atoms fuse and squeeze together, and the density becomes extremely high. A teaspoon of white dwarf star's material weighs a ton.

The sun is also such a frightening end, 6 billion years later, the sun will become a white dwarf, and its death will announce the end of life on our planet.

This will make you wonder how many outside worlds exist and disappear like this.

How many unknown cosmic stories are forever missing.

Fortunately, we are the known story of the universe.

We are lonely again,

It discovered that viruses can appear on its own cells. This is amazing. It is as if amino acids can be randomly combined into proteins. Various purines and pyrimidines can be arranged and combined into RNA molecules, but it does not violate the agreement. Patiently observe this own cell, blue, a light blue blue dot, relying on the residual heat emitted by the central star, and its location is exactly the necessary place for the cradle of life-water.

The location of this dim blue dot is so cute, there are three forms of water, and water happens to be the cradle of life, oh my God, it doesn’t know what will happen, it knows that one day it will fall apart, like I don't know where I came from, and I don't know where I am going to lead.

Perhaps we should be grateful to this universe for creating a unique living environment for us, and giving us an environment full of unknowns. Everything that seems beautiful is like poppies-the surface is bright and beautiful, but in fact, the undercurrent is surging.

Occasionally, a comet slammed into this dark blue spot, bringing life primitive matter and organic matter to this primitive planet, and even sowed the seeds of life.

Slowly, the water in this cell gradually increased, completely turning into a water-filled planet. Waiting and waiting silently, finally one day, a magical thing happened. This is a process full of randomness and uncertainty. Various amino acids make up proteins, and they happen to combine with other substances to become a passable Life evolved from the environment. In the process of forming life, these substances automatically condense to form aggregates. This feature of automatically gathering surrounding materials, once formed into life, will also absorb surrounding materials, remove waste, and improve oneself.

The cold second law of thermodynamics says that all isolated systems evolve in the direction of entropy increase. But the magic of life evolution is that it can exchange matter and energy with the environment, creating negative entropy for itself, so as to maintain itself strong and tough, and maintain upward vitality.

The second law of thermodynamics began a scene of rebellion, and was born as a face that continued to cause negative entropy to survive. This gadget continuously increases entropy to the environment to maintain its continuous vitality. Life actually started with this, and opened a new prologue.

Slowly, this dim blue dot began to produce new things, and the species slowly increased, as if a virus was produced in its own cells. It smiled and wanted to re-evolve, so it rubbed its eyes again. Everything started with early.

This time it was a coincidence that led to this dim blue dot evolving into organisms called humans. They stood out in the evolution of species, became the masters of this planet, survived and multiplied, and became the basic human potential.

The evolution of life is not easy. If the period from the birth of [Earth](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is regarded as a year, although there may be microorganisms in March, it will not be until November. The simplest [fish](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/fish) appears in the third week of the month. Early humans appeared around New Year's Eve, but the time of civilized humans only occupied the last minute.

Human beings have been groping in the dark for a long time. Primitive humans use clumsy hands to depict everything they think on the rock. They fantasize that giving themselves life must be in the unknown outside their known realm. From simply depicting It took millions of years for life to create a glorious civilization, finally traverse the darkness of religion, and finally usher in the dawn of modern science.

The most incredible thing in the universe is that a purely material world can create intelligence. Since humans have discovered this kind of structure called genes, they can believe that even dust can be created through a particularly delicate arrangement. A high-level state of matter like life emerges, and as long as it is given enough time and space, it can evolve intelligence.

I was born on this planet, an ordinary person. Be born, go to school, fall in love, and get married just like most ordinary people.

I gave my lover a necklace with Sisi embellishment. She looked at me and said three words to me.

I told her that this was the product of the beginning of the explosion of the universe and the crystallization of love between you and me.

From the perspective of material abundance, large stars are the finest products in the universe. They can not only produce all the elements, but also because the larger the star, the shorter the life span, and therefore the cycle is also short.

Therefore, Stellar's Big Mac is the most efficient factory for manufacturing elements in the universe. However, the mass limit of the largest star in the universe is one hundred suns. If it is larger, it will disintegrate due to its own nuclear reaction too violently.

Gravity creates elements, but it also binds elements. Small stars can produce about ten kinds of elements, but these elements cannot flow in the universe in the end.

Large stars can produce more elements. Generally, stars that are more than 8 times the mass of the sun can make fusion unparalleled. The high temperature of its core reaches billions of degrees to continuously create incredible fusion, and the energy produced by each fusion makes the star. Expand more. So it is like an onion to form an amazing multi-layer nuclear fusion space, this space can reach 10 billion kilometers, containing the entire solar system.

As the fusion progresses, stars become more and more dangerous. Because the heavier the element, the less energy provided by fusion, and the huge star must be supported by the continuous release of nuclear energy. However, when the fusion reaches the 26th iron element, the crumbling star suffers the most lethal damage—— Because the structure of iron is extremely stable, it does not release energy during fusion.

As a result, the huge and expanding star will collapse because the core loses support.

Therefore, the smashing explosion of stars, the hurricane of energy sweeping the heavens, this is the supernova explosion. At this moment, its energy is equivalent to 10 billion times that of a normal star. At this super-energy moment, all the elements in the universe were fused.

Heavy elements like gold and silver jewelry were born in the explosion of supernovae.

When we wear them, we must remember that it is indeed very expensive for the universe to make high-end products. It needs to scrap a star that is at least 8 times larger than the sun in order to make us wear gold and silver.

I finished typing the code and went out, looking at the sky. First, a shiny red dot appeared in the blue sky, and the red dots began to appear ripples like water patterns. Some golden light dots appeared quietly, and they moved quickly. Brilliant rays of light were drawn in the air until the golden network that enveloped the entire world quietly appeared.

The ubiquitous golden network is like a cobweb encountering flames. It began to collapse a little bit in the huge turbulence, shaking with huge tremors, more and more golden threads began to break, and the network gradually disappeared.

The whole world began to slide towards the edge of collapse.

 Time and space became chaotic, everything no longer had order, everything began to become chaotic and complicated.

 A small grass was growing rapidly in the desert, growing into a big tree at a speed visible to the naked eye, and quickly developing a wild jungle, then disappeared, as if it had never existed.

 Outside the cloudless sky, the meteors became more brilliant. A large meteor shower passed across the sky. There was no flame, but a large frost was falling. The flames under the ground were still burning, and the frost and snow fell on it, but it did not melt. Walls of ice were piled up in the flames.

  Another sun rose slowly, but did not bring the slightest light and heat.

Everything is intertwined between the illusion and the reality, and it is impossible to distinguish what is true and what is false. Even using the most weird imagination in the world, it is impossible to describe this moment.

All things in the universe, life states, all are alternately staged, the sun, the moon and the stars, the sudden birth and the fall, the desert, the sea, the waves rise and disappear, the world changes, the vicissitudes of life, can not feel time, can not feel space, as if passing through a moment century……

Heaven and earth began to overlap.

What happens after overlap?

Through the boundless nothingness, it was a deep and gloomy world, where there was a faint bright spot that stretched endlessly towards the distance.

With a wave of my hand, my body gradually became transparent, and the entity turned into an image, becoming thinner and thinner until it disappeared.

I said this to whom I seemed to say to, but I didn’t seem to say it again. From the bottom of my heart, I silently said to the atoms and molecules that make up my body. Goodbye, my body, the particles that were born at the beginning of the universe, are going to return. Original place, then, is all this nothingness?

My soul quickly fills the entire universe at an unknown speed. When my body is filled with the universe, I become the universe itself. I seem to be everyone, but it seems that no one is. I am Hitler and I am Mohammed. Germany, I am Newton, I am Genghis Khan, I am Napoleon, but I seem to be no one. All atoms and molecules come from me, and I belong to the whole world itself.

All our intertwined joys, angers, sorrows and joys, thousands of conclusive religions, Ideology and economics, all hunters and robbers, all heroes and cowards, all creators and destroyers of civilization, all kings and farmers, all young people in love, all parents whose blood is thicker than water, are full of hope for the world All the children, inventors and explorers, all the spiritual teachers and corrupt politicians, "superstars" and "supreme leaders", all the saints and sinners, are there.

When the universe rapidly explored and became a singularity, I became that singularity. It seems that everyone has become a singularity. But when the universe began, we gathered here, but we seemed to sleep elsewhere. Since the beginning of the universe, we have all known it. The embellishments that make up our bodies seem to be very cordial. From the beginning, they are the most basic elements that make up us.

Now, humans can prove that the universe began with a big bang. However, what mankind is more convinced is that a universe with a special preference for universal gravitation must start with a big bang before everything can be in order.
